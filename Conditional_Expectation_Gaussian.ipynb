      "Now, let's consider the important case of the zero-mean bivariate Gaussian and try to find a  function $h$ that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE). Again,  trying to solve for the conditional expectation by minimizing the error over all possible functions $h$ is generally very, very hard. One alternative is to use parameters for the $h$ function and then just optimize over those. For example, we could assume that $h(Y)= \\alpha Y$ and then use calculus to find the $\\alpha$ parameter.\n",

      "In this section, we showed that the conditional expectation for Gaussian random variables is a linear function, which, by a bizarre coincidence, is also the easiest one to work with. This result is fundamental to all optimal linear filtering problems (e.g. Kalman filter) and is the basis of most of the theory of stochastic processes used in signal processing. Up to this point, we have worked hard to illustrate all of the concepts we will need to unify our understanding of this entire field and figured out multiple approaches to these kinds of problems, most of which are far more difficult to compute. Thus, it is indeed just plain lucky that the most powerful distribution is the easiest to compute as a conditional expectation because it is a linear function. We will come back to this same result again and again as we work our way through these greater concepts."
