That's  a lot of mileage to get a out of an abstraction and it is key to everything we pursue in statistical signal processing because now we can shift between these interpretations to address real problems. Soon, we'll see how to do this with some examples, but first we will collect one staggering result that flows naturally from this abstraction.\n",

      "[Previously](http://python-for-signal-processing.blogspot.com/2012/11/conditional-expectation-and-mean.html), we noted that the conditional expectation is the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) solution to the following problem:\n",

      "$$ \\min_h \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (x - h(y) )^2 dx $$ \n",

      "\n",
      "$$ h_{opt}(Y) = \\mathbb{E}(X|Y) $$\n",
      "\n",
      "which is another way of saying that among all possible functions $h(Y)$, the one that minimizes the MSE is $ \\mathbb{E}(X|Y)$ (see appendix for a quick proof). From our discussion on [projection](http://python-for-signal-processing.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-projection-concept.html), we noted that these MMSE solutions can be thought of as projections onto a subspace that characterizes $Y$. For example, we previously noted that at the point of projection, we have\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\langle X-h_{opt}(Y),Y \\rangle = 0 $$\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "That last step seems pretty innocuous, but it is the step that ties MMSE to conditional expectation to the inner project abstraction, and in so doing, reveals the conditional expectation to be a projection operator for random variables. Before we develop this further, let's grab some quick dividends:\n",
      "\n",
      "From the previous equation, by linearity of the expectation, we may obtain,\n",

      "$$  \\mathbb{E}(X Y) =  \\mathbb{E}(Y \\mathbb{E}(X|Y))$$  \n",

      "which would be tough to compute by direct integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize that $\\mathbb{E}(X|Y)$ *is* in fact **a projection operator**. Recall previously that we noted that the projection operator is idempotent, which means that once we project something onto a subspace, further projections essentially do nothing. Well, in the space of random variables, $\\mathbb{E}(X|\\cdot$) is the idempotent projection as we can show by noting that\n",

The key idea is that because we have these relationships, we can approach difficult problems in multiple ways, depending on which way is more intuitive or tractable in a particular situation.
